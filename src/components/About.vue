            <h3>What are we doing at NFarm?</h3>
            <p>On NFarm we think that 88 Million tons of food waste it's a shame, that's wy we want to unify all of the burocratic processes into one stamp that 100% of the time will assure that there is quality in the meat and that the user will be able to trace it back to where it came from.</p>
